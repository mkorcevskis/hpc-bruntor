            <h2 class="subtitle">"Creating Innovative Digital Solutions in HPC Challenges", January-May 2024</h2>
            <h3>By taking part in this <span class="rtu-brand-name">Riga Technical University (RTU)</span> programme, students will not only gain industry contacts and the opportunity to work with a high-performance computing platform, but will also receive a certificate upon successful completion that will certify their high-level digital skills. Participation in the programme will be equivalent to a two-credit free elective course. The programme does not require prior knowledge of high-performance computing. Students from other Latvian universities are also welcome to apply. This semester, 25&nbsp;students are expected to enrol.</h3>
            <h3>The programme will start in February and run until June. Teaching staff will work with industry to provide students with up-to-date and forward-looking challenges in the field of high-performance computing. Student teams will work with experts and mentors from RTU and industry to develop solutions in the form of a prototype, conceptual project or research, which will be presented at the end of the programme. The solutions will be developed using a supercomputer from Riga Technical University. Students from different study programmes and study levels (from college to PhD) will work together in teams, complementing each other and ensuring knowledge transfer. Senior students will also lead the teams. The RTU Science and Innovation Centre's Design Factory will provide assistance in developing solutions.</h3>

            <h3><span class="bruntor-brand-name">Bruntor</span> is a Latvian hardware start-up developing a micro-mobility solution. It all started back in summer 2021 when the first version of BRUNTOR FUN, an electric off-road skateboard, was made. After winning the Latvian Business Idea Competition “Ideju kauss 2021”, Bruntor kept improving the off-road skateboard. The team joined different programmes and realized they could make something useful like an electric cargo scooter.</h3>
            <h3>In 2024, Bruntor proudly launched the “Greendash” project, co-funded by EIT Urban Mobility, in collaboration with esteemed partners including PostNord, Latvian Post, Riga City Council, and Vefresh. Since then Bruntor have continued to grow, so here they are now – partnering within the RTU HPC programme.</h3>
